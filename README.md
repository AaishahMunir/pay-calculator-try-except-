# ðŸ’¼ Pay Calculator with Overtime & Error Handling

This Python script is an advanced version of the pay calculator.  
It includes both:
- Overtime logic (1.5x pay for hours over 40)
- Error handling using `try/except` to manage invalid (non-numeric) user input

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter:
   - Number of hours worked
   - Hourly rate
2. Converts inputs to `float` using `try/except`:
   - If input is not numeric, prints an error and exits.
3. Calculates:
   - Regular pay (up to 40 hours)
   - Overtime pay for any extra hours
   - Total pay = regular + overtime
4. Displays pay breakdown and total.
## ðŸ§  Skills Practiced

- Input validation (`try` / `except`)
- Arithmetic with conditionals
- User input and error messaging
- Graceful program exit (`quit()`)
